Algorithm SentenceAnalysis
    Initialize variables:
        sentenceLength := 0
        wordCount := 0
        vowelCount := 0
        character := ReadCharacter()  // Assume a function ReadCharacter() reads one character at a time

    WHILE character is not a point
        // Increment the length counter for each character
        sentenceLength := sentenceLength + 1

        // Check if the character is a space to count words
        IF character is a space
            wordCount := wordCount + 1

        // Check if the character is a vowel (assuming English vowels)
        IF character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, or case-insensitive)
            vowelCount := vowelCount + 1

        character := ReadCharacter()  // Read the next character

    // Increment the length for the point
    sentenceLength := sentenceLength + 1

    // Count the last word
    wordCount := wordCount + 1

    // Output the results
    OUTPUT "Length of the sentence:", sentenceLength
    OUTPUT "Number of words in the sentence:", wordCount
    OUTPUT "Number of vowels in the sentence:", vowelCount
